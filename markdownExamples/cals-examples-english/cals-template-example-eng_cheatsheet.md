# Cheatsheet: Random Notes

## Basic Markdown Syntax

- Headers: Use one to six hash symbols ('#') to create header tags, with one hash for the largest header and six hashes for the smallest header.
- Emphasis: Use asterisks or underscores to add emphasis to text. One asterisk/underscore will italicize, two will bold, and three will bold and italicize.
- Lists: Use hyphens, plus signs, or asterisks to create unordered lists, and numbers to create ordered lists.
- Links: Use square brackets to create a clickable link, followed by the URL in parentheses.
- Images: Use an exclamation mark followed by square brackets to insert an image, with the URL in parentheses.
- Code: Use backticks to format inline code, and triple backticks to format blocks of code.

## Advanced Markdown Syntax

- Tables: Use vertical bars and hyphens to create a table, with the header row separated from the body by a horizontal line.
- Blockquotes: Use the greater-than symbol ('>') to create a blockquote.
- Task Lists: Use hyphens and square brackets to create a task list, with an 'x' inside the brackets to indicate a completed task.
- Strikethrough: Use two tildes ('~~') to strikethrough text.
- Footnotes: Use square brackets with a caret and a number to create a footnote reference, and use another set of square brackets with the same number to create the footnote content.

## Tips and Tricks

- Preview your Markdown file in a Markdown editor or converter to see how it will look once rendered.
- Use consistent formatting throughout your document.
- Use descriptive file names and organize your Markdown files in folders.
- Remember that Markdown is designed to be easy to read and write, so don't overcomplicate things!
